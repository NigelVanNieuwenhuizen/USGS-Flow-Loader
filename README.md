# USGS-Flow-Loader
A Python tool for automatically downloading stream flow data from USGS monitoring stations.

Users may specify either a delimited text file (either .txt or .csv) containing a column of desired USGS station IDs, or manually input desired station IDs. 
Once station IDs have been specified, users may enter a date range and output format and run the tool.

This tool is provided as an .exe file for windows users, and a .py script for all other platforms. When the application or script is run, a GUI will open to allow for entry of required parameters.

Please see the manual for more information on operating the tool.
